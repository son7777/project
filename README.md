# Cards-React
BusinessCard-Showcase
The site functions as a digital hub for business cards, making them accessible to various users. Regular visitors are free to explore and view details about different businesses, marking the cards that catch their interest with a like. Users with business accounts have further privileges, enabling them to craft new business cards and populate them with applicable details. Administrative staff hold the controls to regulate user accounts, including the ability to alter or remove them, and toggle their classification between business and regular users.

        Constructed using React.js for the front end and Node.js for the back end, the website's foundation also includes JavaScript as its primary coding language. In addition, the platform incorporates the MUI (Material-UI) library, offering ready-made styling and components.

        The aesthetic design of the platform is created to be welcoming and serene, assisting users in concentrating on the content and smoothly navigating through their desired actions.

        The main aim of the site is the dissemination of business-related information, without the distraction of unrelated content beyond the core business data.
